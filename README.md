## Hi there 👋


I’m an Economist interested in Causal Inference, Econometrics, Data Science and Labor Economics.  Here is my [website](https://rengifoandres.github.io).

Currently, I am a Senior Research Associate  at **Good Business Lab** Latin America. Previously I was a research assistant at **[Harvard Business School](https://d3.harvard.edu/digital-reskilling/our-team/)**. 
I also worked at the Business Department at **Universidad de los Andes**. 

I hold an MSc in Economics from Universidad de los Andes and a Bachelor’s degree from Universidad del Valle.

In addition to research, I find great joy in teaching. I was the Teaching Assistant (TA) for the course Big Data and Machine Learning at Universidad de los Andes.

- 🔭 I’m currently working with firm's administrative data to understant how to improve managerial practices.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning new Big Data and Machine Learning techniques and how to apply them to interesting Economic questions.
- 💬 Have an idea and want to collaborate, fell free to send me an [email](mailto:a.rengifoj.econ@gmail.com).
- ⚡ Fun fact: I want to be a writer, but with the advent of AI, I don’t know if there will still be room for a human—imperfect and messy—writer.
